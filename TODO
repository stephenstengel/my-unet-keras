Clean up the code to merge to main

Add all years

confusion matrix

k folds

Print runtime to a file.

Add ability to start from saved model so I don't take all day to test evry tiny change.

save image slice indexes when cutting up images for stitching back together purposes.

!!! Use scikit-images built in functions to convert image types !!!

"You should never use astype on an image, because it violates these assumptions about the dtype range:"
Converting all my float images to uint8 should give me 4 times more memory to work with on GPU

Use jaccard and dice to estimate veracity.

Add jaccard and dice as functions to use during training.

Add nicer output of the four images for easier viewing.

Remove global variables; replace with function passing? how will that work with loading a model? if loading model, skip the import steps; add command line flag to load model.

Add function to start program using a saved model and saved images.

-- nice later stuff
Make a GUI to run tests easier. There could be radio buttons for each of the valid flags and a switch for starting fom a saved model. The switch could open a separate tab or something. There could be a built in console readout. I've done a bit of python gtk so it shouldn't be too difficult to hack something together.

Use os independent code for the file management. like os.path.join() etc

Investigate training on rectangles?
