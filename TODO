Clean up the code to merge to main

Add the full image predict functionality

Use jaccard and dice to estimate veracity.

Add jaccard and dice as functions to use during training.

Add nicer output of the four images for easier viewing.

Remove global variables; replace with function passing? how will that work with loading a model? if loading model, skip the import steps; add command line flag to load model.

Add function to start program using a saved model and saved images.

-- nice later stuff
Make a GUI to run tests easier. There could be radio buttons for each of the valid flags and a switch for starting fom a saved model. The switch could open a separate tab or something. There could be a built in console readout. I've done a bit of python gtk so it shouldn't be too difficult to hack something together.
